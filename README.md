Option 1: Use IntestLine via docker

Option 2: Use IntestLine application implemented in FASTGenomics A quick way to try IntestLine. Be aware that the configureation of the server is very limited (2 vCPUs @2.1GHz, 16 GB RAM). Therefore it will take a while to unroll a large dataset. For example, 26s for the demo dataset containing 10k cells, and xx min for a dataset with 150k cells.

Option 3: Use IntestLine locally (Advanced users)
